# Hello World

Welcome to my new website. This isn't just a redesign - it's a reset.

## Why the Revamp?

### A New Way of Building

A few months ago, I discovered Claude Code and started coding with AI. It completely changed how I work. This entire website - the backend, the theme system, everything - was built using AI-assisted development. It's a new skill set I'm excited to explore further, and this site is proof of what's possible.

### A Shift in Direction

I read a blog post from PostHog about Product Engineering, and it resonated deeply with me. The idea of being more than just a developer - of owning the entire product experience, from code to user impact - that's what I want to do. This website reflects that shift.

### Something More... Me

My old WordPress site was functional but forgettable. Too simple. Too generic. It didn't show who I am.

I wanted something creative. Something that reflects my personality (personalities?). Something lightweight that I actually own and understand. So I built it from scratch - multiple themes, a blog system, all the weird details that make it mine.

## Why Start a Blog?

Honestly? I've wanted to do this for years but kept putting it off. I told myself I was bad at writing. But the truth is, I've never really tried. And if I don't try, I'll never know.

Training is key. That's what I tell myself about everything else - why should writing be different?

Something changed recently. As I've grown in my career - becoming a lead, managing people, having more conversations with brilliant humans - I've realized something: **my words have value**.

My ideas aren't revolutionary, but they're mine. And more often than I expected, people share them. They want to talk. They want to exchange. And those conversations have been some of the most rewarding parts of my work.

So I thought: why not keep a trace of it somewhere?

## What This Is Really About

This blog is my attempt to leave a mark on the internet. A record of who I am, what I think, and what I want to do with my life.

Not for fame. Not for followers. Just for the simple fact that I existed, I thought about things, and maybe - just maybe - some of it will resonate with someone else.

## What's Next

I'll be writing about:

- **Product Engineering** - Building things that matter, end to end
- **AI-Assisted Development** - What I'm learning from coding with Claude
- **Leadership & Growth** - Lessons from managing and collaborating with people
- **Random Thoughts** - Because not everything needs a category

Thanks for being here. Let's see where this goes.
