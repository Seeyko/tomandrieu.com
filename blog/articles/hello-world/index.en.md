Welcome to my new website.

This isn't just a redesign. Not an update to showcase new projects. **It's a reset.**

## Why yet another new version?

### A new way to build

A few months ago, in 2025, I discovered AI-assisted development.

At first, a few questions asked to ChatGPT. Then plugins for my editor: GitHub Copilot. And for fun (and a bit of [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)), I tried Cursor.

What a revelation.

At first, it was just autocompletion. As if the editor was reading my mind. It knew where I wanted to go, predicted the logical next steps of my actions.

Then I wanted to hand over the reins. Give it more complex missions.

There were disappointments. Errors. Code that wasn't rigorous, impossible to maintain long-term. Duplication, questionable functions...

But I learned to tame the beast. To use it for tedious tasks, but also to design better. Test new technologies. See how far I could go.

I built entire systems. Microservices, event-driven, scalable architecture. Real-time chats, payment systems capable of handling millions of messages per day.

In a few days. Where before, I would have spent months.

And I'm ending the year with Claude Code. A seemingly simple tool that runs in a terminal. Configurable, customizable at will.

So I customize it. I frame it. I teach it to think and code like me.

I've spent years learning, being mentored by people smarter than me. This knowledge sets me apart. I hope it won't be in vain.

Everyone can churn out code thanks to AI. But not everyone knows what makes a system that works. That holds up. That remains robust over time.

But these new tools also made me reflect. On what I really want to do.

### A change of direction

This year, I took time to read.

The newsletters from the PostHog team struck me: [Product for Engineers](https://newsletter.posthog.com/). It resonated with me. A new way of seeing my work.

The idea that I'm not just a developer.

For years I've been designing and creating solutions. But I knew my developer perspective wasn't enough to succeed in this field.

And most importantly: how do I translate this passion into the corporate world as I know it?

A developer at the bottom of the chain, in execution. Above: POs, PMs, a director. Layers that dilute instructions and blur common sense.

I'm not a PO, nor a PM. These aren't jobs I would enjoy. But their decisions sometimes seem irrational to me. Disconnected from what really matters: **the user and the product**.

The idea of the Product Engineer that will drive my career? A developer responsible for the entire product experience. From code to user impact.

That's what I want to do.

I was already doing it on my side projects. Without conviction, because it had to be done and I didn't have a PM. I always thought in terms of "what will this cost me to develop".

Today, with this new way of building, I can abstract away from all that. Work differently. That's the change I want to reflect with this new site.

### Something more... personal

My old WordPress site did the job. But it was bland. It didn't allow me to express myself.

I wanted something more creative. That reflects me. That I can have fun with. Something lightweight, that I master and understand.

So with my new colleague Claude, I rebuilt it from scratch. Vanilla JS, a small Go backend for articles. Nothing fancy. Still room for improvement, but it's here. And it suits me.

## Why start writing articles?

Honestly? Because I've always wanted to. But I couldn't see what it would bring.

I convinced myself I couldn't write. Because I never wrote. (Yet I got 18/20 on the creative writing exam in my French baccalaureate. One of my absolute joys.)

The truth? I never really tried. And if I don't try, no one will do it for me.

This year, things are different.

Something changed recently.

I'm growing in my career. Becoming a lead. Manager. Supervising. Getting closer to humans. 2025 was rich in encounters. Conversations with fantastic people.

I realized something: **my words have value.**

My ideas aren't revolutionary. But they're mine. And more often than I think, people share them. Or are willing to listen. It can resonate with them too.

They want to share, listen, debate. These conversations are among the most rewarding aspects of my work. And my life.

Life is made of exchanges. Every word can change the trajectory of a life.

So I thought: why not keep a record?

## What is this really about?

These articles are an attempt to leave a trace. A testimony. Who I am, my era, my way of seeing things.

Not for glory. Not for followers. Just because I exist. Because I think about things. And maybe someone will read it and it will resonate with them.

## What to expect

In this spirit, I'll write about:

- **Product Engineering** — Building things that matter, end to end
- **AI and development** — What I'm learning in this new agentic world
- **Leadership** — Collaborating, communicating, growing with others
- **Random stuff** — Because not everything needs to be categorized

Thanks for being here.

Let's see where this takes us.
